# Sunereum Labs: Proposed Solar Data Oracles on Stellar

## Overview
Sunereum Labs leverages Stellar's Soroban smart contracts to create a first-of-its-kind decentralized energy data platform for clean energy infrastructure. By combining Soroban's powerful smart contract capabilities with IoT data streams, we're enabling transparent, automated data management for renewable energy assets globally.

## Why Stellar for Clean Energy Data?

### 1. Global Settlement Layer

- **Fast Finality**: Essential for rapid data processing
- **Low Transaction Costs**: Enables microtransactions for emerging markets
- **Built-in DEX**: Facilitates energy payments in local currencies

### 2. Soroban Smart Contract Innovation

#### Oracle Implementation
```rust
pub struct Inverter {
    device_id: String,
    policy_id: String,
    last_ping: u64,

## Internal Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain

Sunereum Labs has developed an internal Hyperledger Fabric blockchain designed to track and represent every state change of an inverter on a solar site. This blockchain ensures that all data related to the performance and status of solar inverters is securely recorded and immutable. The key features of this blockchain include:

- **State Change Tracking**: Every state change of an inverter, including operational status, energy production, and maintenance records, is recorded on the blockchain.
- **Immutable Records**: Once recorded, the data cannot be altered, ensuring the integrity and reliability of the information.
- **Decentralized Verification**: Multiple nodes in the network verify each transaction, enhancing the security and trustworthiness of the data.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: The blockchain allows for real-time monitoring of inverter performance, enabling proactive maintenance and rapid response to issues.

## Vision with Soroban and the Stellar Blockchain

Our vision with Soroban and the Stellar blockchain is to create an oracle where developers and services can build solutions around energy. This vision is particularly relevant for regions like Africa, where there are more pay-as-you-go options for energy and a different paradigm than what is commonly expected in the US and many other nations. The key aspects of this vision include:

- **Energy Solutions Oracle**: By leveraging Soroban and the Stellar blockchain, we aim to create a reliable and verifiable oracle that provides real-time data on energy production and consumption. This oracle can be used by developers to build innovative energy solutions tailored to the needs of different regions.
- **Pay-as-You-Go Energy**: The oracle will support pay-as-you-go energy models, which are crucial for providing affordable and accessible energy in regions with limited infrastructure.
- **Cross-Border Transactions**: The integration with Stellar's blockchain will facilitate cross-border transactions, enabling seamless payment and settlement for energy services.
- **Decentralized Applications**: Developers can build decentralized applications (dApps) on top of the oracle, offering a wide range of services such as energy trading, microgrid management, and renewable energy financing.

## Importance of Reliable and Verifiable Systems

Reliable and verifiable systems around energy are paramount to helping millions of people access stable energy and transact against it. The importance of these systems can be summarized as follows:

- **Access to Stable Energy**: Reliable systems ensure that communities have consistent access to energy, which is essential for economic development and improving quality of life.
- **Transparency and Trust**: Verifiable systems provide transparency in energy production and consumption, building trust among stakeholders and reducing the risk of fraud.
- **Efficient Energy Management**: By accurately tracking energy data, these systems enable efficient management of energy resources, reducing waste and optimizing usage.
- **Empowerment of Communities**: Access to reliable energy empowers communities to engage in economic activities, improve education and healthcare, and enhance overall well-being.

## Solar Energy SDK

It is important to emphasize that our focus is less about insurance and more about creating a Solar Energy SDK. This SDK will enable other developers and builders to access and utilize energy production and consumption data. This data can be valuable for various applications, including transactions, credit assessments, and more. By providing a comprehensive SDK, we aim to foster innovation and development in the energy sector.

## Accessible Data from Soroban Oracles

We envision that both inverter (production side) and meter (consumption side) data will be accessible from these Soroban Oracles. This comprehensive data access will enable developers to create more accurate and reliable energy solutions, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of energy management systems.
